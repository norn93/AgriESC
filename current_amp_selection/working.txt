Using http://www.nutsvolts.com/magazine/article/how_to_choose_an_operational_amplifier
Searching Digikey for active parts in stock with a quantity of 10, ordering by price
Looking for current sense op amps

Not acceptable:
AP4305: Power supply voltage too low
INAx181: Maximum common mode voltage too low at 26 V
Si8540: Unidirectional
TS94033: Too slow of a slew rate at 10mV/us, gain too high at 50, horrible temperature characteristics
CS30: High input offset drift, gain is 20, high output offset drift, low accuracy generally, unidirectional
TSC888: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
MAX437X: No negative common mode range, unidrectional
TS110X: Common mode input range too low at 27 V
MAX9918: Gain of 45 is too high
MAX4173: No negative common mode range
INA21x: Gain too high at 50, unidirectional
TSC1021: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
TSC101: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
MAX9928: Common mode range too low at 28 V
MAX9938: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
MAX4372T: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
SC310: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
MAX99XX: Too much input offset voltage drift!!! Close. Gain is a little high maybe, but the adjustable one is OK (with more of the other problem)
MAX9634: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
MAX4081: Looks OK
TSC102: No negative common mode range, unidirectional
LMP8640: Unidirectional
ISL28005: Unidirectional
MAX9610: Unidirectional
CS70: Unidirectional
LT6106: Unidirectional
MAX961X: Unidirectional
MAX44284: Unidirectional
LMP8645: Unidirectional
MAX992X: Common mode range is too low at 28 V

Good so far:
MAX9918/20
MAX4081
LT1787 (expensive)
