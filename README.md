# AgriESC
A brushless motor driver for small to medium sized motors

This project was forked from and inspired by antonchromjak's MINI4 (Mini VESC: https://github.com/antonchromjak/MINI4) and was practically copied from Benjamin Vedder's Brushless Motor Controller (VESC: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-hardware). It is an attempt to build a slightly cheaper motor controller for 24 V/10 A motors.
